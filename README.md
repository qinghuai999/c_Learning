# C_Learning

## Introduction
This repository serves two purposes:
1) Practice building a real-world, company-style C project structure and workflow (modular code, clear directory layout, maintainable builds).
2) Complete university coursework, including weekly tasks and larger assignments.

## Project Structure
├── src/                 # Source code (.c)
├── include/             # Header files (.h)
├── lib/                 # Libraries (third-party or self-written modules)
├── test/                # Tests (if any)
├── docs/                # Notes / documentation
├── CMakeLists.txt       # CMake build configuration
├── main.c               # Example entry file (if kept)
└── build/               # Build output (recommended: do not commit)

**Notes**
- `cmake-build-debug/` is usually generated by CLion and should be ignored (not part of the core structure).
- Executables like `a.out` or `main` should not be committed.

## Build & Run

### Option A: CLion (Recommended)
1. Open the project in CLion
2. CLion loads `CMakeLists.txt` automatically
3. Click **Run** to build and execute

### Option B: CMake (Command Line)
From the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./main
